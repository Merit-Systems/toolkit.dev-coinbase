# Toolkit System Prompts Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new `systemPrompt` field for ServerToolkit and integrated toolkit-specific system prompts into the chat system prompt.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ServerToolkit Type Definition
- **File**: `src/toolkits/types.ts`
- **Change**: Added required `systemPrompt: string` field to `ServerToolkit` type

### 2. Modified createServerToolkit Function
- **File**: `src/toolkits/create-toolkit.ts`  
- **Change**: Updated function signature to accept `systemPrompt` parameter and include it in returned toolkit

### 3. Updated All Server Toolkit Implementations
Added comprehensive system prompts for each toolkit explaining their tools and usage patterns:

#### Exa Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/exa/server.ts`)
- Explains 8 different search tools (Search, Research Papers, Company Research, etc.)
- Provides tool sequencing guidelines for comprehensive search strategies
- Suggests starting with broad searches then drilling down to specific domains

#### Image Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/image/server.ts`)
- Explains AI image generation capabilities
- Provides guidelines for creating detailed, descriptive prompts
- Suggests style and composition specifications for better results

#### GitHub Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/github/server.ts`)
- Explains repository search, code search, user search, and repo info tools
- Provides sequencing strategies for repository discovery and code investigation
- Includes GitHub search syntax best practices

#### Google Calendar Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/google-calendar/server.ts`)
- Explains calendar management and event operations
- Provides workflows for calendar overview, event management, and schedule analysis
- Includes best practices for date ranges and multi-calendar operations

#### Google Drive Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/google-drive/server.ts`)
- Explains file search and content reading capabilities
- Provides workflows for file discovery and content analysis
- Includes search optimization strategies

#### Mem0 Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/mem0/server.ts`)
- Explains persistent memory storage and retrieval
- Provides workflows for information capture and context retrieval
- Emphasizes personalized, continuous learning capabilities

#### Notion Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/notion/server.ts`)
- Explains comprehensive workspace management with 9 different tools
- Provides complex workflows for database operations, content creation, and analysis
- Includes collaboration and permission considerations

#### E2B Toolkit (`src/toolkits/toolkits/e2b/server.ts`)
- Explains secure code execution capabilities
- Provides guidelines for development support and data processing
- Includes security and best practice considerations

### 4. Enhanced Chat System Prompt
- **File**: `src/app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added collection of system prompts from selected toolkits
  - Enhanced system prompt to include "Available Toolkits" section
  - System prompt now dynamically includes detailed instructions for each active toolkit

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Contextual Guidance**: The AI now receives detailed instructions about each toolkit's capabilities and optimal usage patterns

2. **Tool Sequencing**: System prompts explain how tools within each toolkit work together and in what order they should be used

3. **Best Practices**: Each toolkit includes specific best practices and optimization strategies

4. **Dynamic Integration**: System prompts are only included for actively selected toolkits, keeping the context relevant and concise

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 8 toolkits now have detailed system prompts explaining their full capabilities

## Result
The chat system now provides intelligent, context-aware assistance for toolkit usage, with detailed guidance on how to effectively use each toolkit's tools individually and in combination for optimal results.
